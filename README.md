# Travelling Salesman Problem with Drones

## Overview
This project aims to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using drones. The TSP is a classic problem in computer science and operations research where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of given cities exactly once and returns to the original city. Utilizing drones introduces a dynamic aspect to the problem, potentially optimizing the route further and overcoming obstacles.

## Features
- **TSP Solver**: Implements various algorithms for solving the TSP, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization.
- **Drone Integration**: Incorporates drones into the TSP solution, allowing for more flexible and efficient route planning.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualization tools to display the TSP solution and drone routes on a map for better understanding and analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
